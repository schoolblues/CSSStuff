# Indiviual Assignment Three Static Web App

I used a template as a starting point. Hopefully that doesn't hurt me. <br>
The reason for the template is just because I thought no one really does one a <br>
website completely from scratch. I have provided a link to the template I used below. <br>
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp <br>
It's the Food Blog Template. Sixth from the top. <br>

Well I did something very dumb, and made my hamburger menu work through file paths. <br>
Which means that no of my buttons will work, and switch between pages unless you  <br>
go and manually change the file path. I just didn't want you to think I intentionally <br>
submitted a broken assignment. Thank you for your time.
